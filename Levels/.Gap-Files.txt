This isn't specific to PSP, but the THAW engine tony hawk games, but I haven't seen any other documentation about it so i'm putting it in here.

Header/Gap Ammount

The gap files use pretty common byte to value things for everything, the first 8 bytes seem to be specific to each level, but not changing them
when making new files has seemed to have no impact on them function fine for the new level, and gap tracking and all that so you can ignore them.
After those 8 bytes, there is a two bytes which are the number of gaps in the gap file, so if there is like 30 gaps in the map then the byte should
be 1E 00. 

Gap Scores, String Length, and String

After those two bytes, the bytes for each gap are introduced, now they have no padding, so they are basically back to back, so i'll run through
each part of the gap themselves, the first byte is the score for the gap, there are 5 bytes inbetween the score, and string, the last one 
of these 5 are for the string length but then it might be 4 bytes for the score, though I have not ran into any gaps with a score 3 or 4 bytes big, but after 
the score bytes, there is a byte which is the length of the gap name, so if the gap name is 8 characters long, then the string byte is 08, and then after the string
byte, is the string for the gap name, and then after that, the next gap starts, and repeat till you get to the end.

For example, these bytes are for the Post Hop gap in Philly (from THUG2) which I put into THPM 
32 00 00 00 08 50 6F 73 74 20 48 6F 70
The first byte is the score which is 50
Then the 08 is the length of the gap name, which is 8 characters long (including the space as a char)
Then the rest are the text or string for the gap name.
