The texture names on skins and mdls are stored like qbkeys, and are right before 00 00 00 00 80 80 80 00
so you can use roq or something to get the qbkey for the texture (for if you can't import the model into blender to check)
or if you need to change it to something you know for texture swaping (as texture swaps use strings instead of qbkeys).
