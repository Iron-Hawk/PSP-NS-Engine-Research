The Pattern They Follow

The bone bytes are stored in two bytes, following a pattern of
00 00
00 04
00 08
00 0C
and then the first byte goes up by one after that loop, so it would be 
1 = 00 00
2 = 00 04
3 = 00 08
4 = 00 0C
5 = 01 00
6 = 01 04
7 = 01 08
8 = 01 0C
and so on

Location

The bone bytes are located after all the header, material, and texture data, and each bone byte follows after either 2A or 00 0A,
if there is a byte that isn't after one of these, than it most likely isn't a bone byte and instead part of the mesh and messing
with it can break the model. There are some rare instances where all these will line up and yet it still wont be a bone byte, another
way to make sure you are editing a bone byte is make sure the bytes are after a 3A but before a 9B, it will still follow the rules above
of the bytes needing to have a 2A or 00 0A before it, but combine these two togther and you should be able to make sure your only editing
the bone bytes and not other model data.
